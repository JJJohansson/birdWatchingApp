# birdWatchingApp

## Description
The purpose of this app is to provide bird watching enthusiasts a way to log their sightings. The sightings will be saved locally and will be listed listen in order based on the time of the sightings.

## Technologies used
* React Native
* NativeBase
* SQLite
* Expo

## How to run the app?
Currently the app is still in development stage and it has to be run with Expo on mobile. Expo can be downloaded from any app store and can be run in an emulated mobile device as well.
After you've installed expo, do the following:

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/heikunKeikun/birdWatchingApp
```

Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies
```
cd birdWatchingApp
npm install
```

After the installation, run the following command to start Expo:
```
expo start
```

When the Expo is up and running, a website should open with a QR-code. Open up the Expo app on your mobile and scan the QR-code.
Alternatively, you can select "Run on Android device/emulator" if you are running an emulator.
